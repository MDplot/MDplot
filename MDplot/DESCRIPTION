Title: Visualizing Molecular Dynamics analysis
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), methods, MASS, RColorBrewer, gplots, gtools
Description: The purpose of MDplot is, to provide automatization for plot generation succeeding common 
              molecular dynamics analyses. This includes straightforward plots, such as RMSD and RMSF but also more 
              sophisticated ones such as dihedral angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and DSSP analysis.

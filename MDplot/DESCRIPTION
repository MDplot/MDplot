Title: Visualising Molecular Dynamics Analyses
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), methods, MASS, RColorBrewer, gplots, gtools
Suggests: R.rsp
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp
Description: Provides automatisation for plot generation succeeding common molecular dynamics analyses.
             This includes straightforward plots, such as RMSD (Root-Mean-Square-Deviation) and
             RMSF (Root-Mean-Square-Fluctuation) but also more sophisticated ones such as
             dihedral angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and
             DSSP (Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis. Currently able to load
             GROMOS, GROMACS and AMBER formats, respectively.

Title: Visualizing Molecular Dynamics Analyses
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), methods, MASS, RColorBrewer, gplots, gtools
Description: Provides automatization for plot generation succeeding common molecular dynamics analyses.
             This includes straightforward plots, such as RMSD (Root-Mean-Square-Deviation) and
             RMSF (Root-Mean-Square-Fluctuation) but also more sophisticated ones such as
             dihedral angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and
             DSSP (Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis.
